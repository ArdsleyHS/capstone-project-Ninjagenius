                        We are a tutoring service whose sole goal is to improve the quality of education your child receives. Kids of all ages experience difficulties in school for various reasons, including not getting enough individual attention from their teachers, not being able to learn via the standardized methods, or not being motivated to learn due to a lack of engaging approach to subject matter from their educators. Our tutoring program solves most if not all of these problems. We have developed a method of teaching that can be applied to any student. It combines Chinese, Finnish, and American teaching styles into one that has seen great success amongst those who have previously struggled in school. Our team is comprised of high school students, college students, and teachers all over the United States who have been trained on how to use our proprietary teaching strategies. To date, we are able to report excellent results. Students who were C Students coming into High School and enrolled in our program had GPAs ranging from 3.5-4.0 after just one year of instruction. We offer a wide variety of courses for all levels that can help your child succeed. Our children are our future, and therefore, it is our duty to give each and every one of them their best chance at success and fulfillment of their potential.
